    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Adrian, {{ age(6, 9, 2000) }} years old and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science,
      with a strong passion for backend development and a growing interest in frontend technologies.
      Over the past five years, I’ve developed my skills in various programming languages, including Kotlin, Java, C# and recently TypeScript,
      and I’m always eager to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is a space where I aim to showcase my projects, share my journey, and connect with others.
      While I don't offer services just yet, I’m open to any opportunities to continue growing and refine my expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides of coding, I’m also a firefighter and love staying active through volleyball and cycling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!
