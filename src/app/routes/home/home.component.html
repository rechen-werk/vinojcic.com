    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Adrian, {{ age(6, 9, 2000) }} years old and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science,
      with a strong passion for backend development and a growing interest in frontend technologies.
      Over the past five years, I’ve developed my skills in various programming languages, including Kotlin, Java, C# and recently TypeScript,
      and I’m always eager to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This website is a space where I aim to showcase my projects, share my journey, and connect with others.
      I must warn you that I just started creating this website and many subpages are not written yet.
      This website is created only in my free time, while I am also writing my masters thesis.
      <!--While I don't offer services just yet, I’m open to any opportunities to continue growing and refine my expertise.-->
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides of coding, I’m also a firefighter and love staying active through volleyball and cycling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!

          My second, and I assume last, internship was at <a href="https://www.dynatrace.com/"
                                                             target="_blank">Dynatrace</a>.
          Dynatrace is a big international company with roots in <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linz"
                                                                    target="_blank">Linz</a>, which is also the location
          where I took my internship.
          I got placed in the Cloud Access Engineering team and got tasked with creating a prototype for improving their
          process of reviewing permissions in order to stay <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes%E2%80%93Oxley_Act" target="_blank">SOX compliant</a>.
          My major takeaways from working at this company are a kind team, the agile scrum workflow at work, and
          improvements in my Spring and Kotlin skills.
          A negative and probably inherent takeaway is the time it takes to get something done when working corporately.

          My first internship was at <a href="https://rzlsoftware.at/" target="_blank">RZL</a>.
          This is a medium-sized company in the heart of the <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innviertel"
                                                                target="_blank">Innviertel</a>, where I come from.
          At RZL they tasked me to <span class="italic secondary huh"

          working on an internal tool which distributes their software across their servers.
          The people there are very kind and my mentor was always there if I had any question.
          The main thing I took from this internship is, how to work with git and a better knowledge about C#.

          As a student I quickly decided to take a tutoring job.
          Since I liked the lectures from <a href="https://www.ssw.jku.at/" target="_blank">SSW</a> best, I took the
          first opportunity to take a position at their institute.
          At this position my task changed over the years. First it was to answer Students' questions in the Tutorial
          for <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/SW1/VL/index.html" target="_blank">Software Development
          1</a>,
          and correct homeworks in the lectures <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/SW2/VL/index.html"
                                                   target="_blank">Software Development 2</a> and later the follow up
          courses <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/PSW2/2024/index.html" target="_blank">Practical in
          Software Development 2</a> and <a href="https://ssw.jku.at/Teaching/Lectures/CB/VL/" target="_blank">Compiler

          At <a href="https://www.naschmax.at/" target="_blank">Naschmax</a> I got into first contact with working at
          age 17.
          I worked here about once a week on the weekend while going to school.
          While being employed, my task was to sell sweets in various locations in Austria.
          Mainly in the upper austrian region, but sometimes we also went to bigger venues like the
          <a href="https://www.dult.at/de/" target="_blank">Dult</a> in Salzburg or the <a
          href="https://www.villacherkirchtag.at/austrias-largest-traditional-festival/" target="_blank">Kirchtag</a> in
          Villach.
          A fun event was the Linzer <a href="https://urfahranermarkt.com/" target="_blank">Urfix</a> which took place
          twice a year.

            Right after school I started studying Mathematics at JKU, but quickly I realized that this topic is too dry.
            Immediately in the next semester I switched to studying Informatics.
            Life has been better since.

            In Austria one has to attain Matura before being admitted to University.
            During the time in school I got elected as a vice student representative and in our term we achieved that
            our school adapts some nice merch.
            The entire planning, and execution was done by us (kinda proud of that one).
            The end of this time was awarded with an diploma with excellence.
