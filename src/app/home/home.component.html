      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science, with a strong passion for backend development and a growing interest in frontend technologies. Over the past five years, I’ve developed my skills in various programming languages, including Kotlin, Java, C# and recently TypeScript, and I’m always eager to learn more.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is a space where I aim to showcase my projects, share my journey, and connect with others—especially potential employers who are looking for a dedicated and versatile programmer. While I don't offer services just yet, I’m open to exploring future opportunities as I continue to grow and refine my expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I’m also a firefighter and love staying active through volleyball and cycling. These experiences have shaped my ability to work under pressure, collaborate effectively, and stay disciplined—qualities that I bring into my work as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!
